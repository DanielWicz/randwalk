# Random Walk Molecular Simulation
This project is a simple molecular simulation with simple reaction model
using Random Walk algorithm. It was made as an assignment for advanced
numerical methods course.
## Getting started
### Prerequisites
* Python version >= 3.4
* Numpy module 
### Running the program
To run the program you have to import this package 
and create ```RunProgram``` object with argument ```numofiter > 0```,
i.e ```RunProgram(numofiter=1000)```.
